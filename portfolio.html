<h1>Customer Success Marketing at Salesforce</h1>
	<p>I joined the Marketing organization to help improve contnet experiences for our customers and empower our production teams to scale.</p> 
	<p>To improve content, I worked closely with PMMs on campaign journeys, messaging strategy, and asset creation, advocating for human-centered design and customer-first storytelling. To address scaling content, I worked with leadership to solidify clear processes, developed templates for common asset types, and piloted the Writer AI tool to generate on-brand, accurate content faster.</p>

<h1>Contract Renewals Reimagined at Salesforce</h1>
	<p>The renewals team needed to make a clear impact on their attributed revenue. They worked with my content team to make it easier for customers to renew contracts that required little to no adjustment.</p> 
	<p>At the time, a customers call their Account Executive to renew a contract. I helped develop an email and web based expereince to provide regular reminders, an option to renew a contract from the web, and a path for common changes that did not require a phone call. We also added a values-based offer to include renewals customers in a net-zero program to plant trees in their name.</p> 
	<p>I influenced the experience flow, developed a messaging strategy, and wrote the copy. This change not only improved the bottom line for renewasl, but I was also able to inprove the customer experience with Salesforce products by making it easier and simpler for a customer to have active control of their contract needs.</p>

<h1>Giving Back with Creative Branding</h1>
	<p>Early in my time at Salesforce, I worked on a volunteer project to give the non-profit Astriid a brand makeover.</p>
	<p>This was a foundational experience, because I had the opportunity to give back by having a real impact on an organization I care about. It was also an opportunity to help lead a full-service brand development and design package. We spent a concentrated period of time exploring a human-centered design approach, workshopping ideas, and delivering a brand playbook with ready-to-go design and copy.</p>
