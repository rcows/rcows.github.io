<h1>Challenge and Goal</h1>
	<p><b>Challenge:</b> Customer Success hosted a series of disparate hub websites that indexed clusters of learning resources. The pages were built to address top support use cases and promote shifting onboarding and adoption features and products. As a result, customers encountered a set of recommendations and CTAs that reflected internal structures and objectives rather than customer needs. Looking at these hub pages, a customer had to take in all of the potential categories and content, decide which was right for them based on jargony language, and bookmark pages if they wanted to come back. From design to copy, these pages were outdated and difficult to navigate.</p> 
	<p><b>Goal:</b> Partnering with Product, Design, Engineering, and Strategy teams, I helped develop a content and messaging strategy to revamp the onboarding and adoption customer experience. We wanted to create a responsive, dynamic experience that would fit each customer's unique position in their adoption of each product they owned. This experience needed to show up where customers worked with our products and it needed to show a consistent perspective, speaking from our brand voice and guiding customers as an expert advisor.</p>

<h1>Experience Development</h1>
	<p>I found that each of the organizations within Customer Success were siloed. They had different sets of customer journeys and recommendations that led customers toward their individual business goals. So, the content they produced pulled customers in different directions. I helped connect these teams, explore customer research, and align on unified recommendation paths. Each team could still work toward their business goals effectively within a greater, human-centered customer experience.</p> 
	<p>With the paths we aligned on, Content and Design used design thinking methods to map and prototype an ambitious and first-of-its-kind Customer Success experience. We created a core flow of dynamic content that could show up in product walkthroughs and guidance, a web experience, a mobile app, and via email. This required a unique combination of skills and helped me hone my ability to write dynamic, mobile-first UX copy, design content flows, explore customer research, and provide input on creative work. I found that beyond my writing and strategy skills, I'm good at connecting cross-functional teams, building an informed perspective, and aligning everyone on a central vision.</p>

<h1>Delivery</h1>
	<p>Our launch included the web, email, and in-product experience we had developed. It was called the Salesforce Success Center. (Mobile was pushed to a later date.) Across each channel, customers saw a clear onboarding and adoption path that took their products, role, journey position, and Customer Success services into account. It was essential to tell a customer that we knew where they were, where they've been, what challenges might be in front of them, and what to do next. We could point them to self-serve how-to content, webinars, in-person events near them, or one-on-one guidance sessions. The experience could learn their preferences through progressive profiling and, for instance, surface a video first if they liked videos best. </p>
	<p>After launch, I helped develop templates and processes so that other writers and content designers could quickly build content that would fit our design systems. For instance, our templates made it so that writers, editors, stakeholders, designers, and engineers could all rely on the same copy document. I then became responsible for ensuring that all Success Center content was on-brand and serving our customer needs. This required a nuanced approach to brand voice, tailoring the tone to fit Customer Success moments, showing up as a trusted advisor.</p>

<h1>Lessons Learned</h1>
	<p>This project more than any other in my career showed me what I wanted to do. I love diving into customer research, understanding business goals, learning about design systems, and writing for dynamic, on-brand customer experiences. I learned how to balance ambitious, innovative content work with the business needs and concerns of key stakeholders, ensuring that wherever we land, it's a real improvement. Through human-centered design thinking, creative problem solving, and cross-functional collaboration, I always develop a clear perspective and keep teams aligned on one thing: delivering the best customer experience possible.</p>
